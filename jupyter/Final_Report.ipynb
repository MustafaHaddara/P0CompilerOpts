    "## Introduction\n",
    "The compiler problem is generally solved; that is, the task of translating an input text based on a known grammar and rules describing the desired output has a generally accepted solution. However, due to the vagueness and abstractness of the grammar and rules, the resulting code may be unnecessarily complex or inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The job of a compiler optimization is to make the resulting code more efficient, either in memory use or cpu time. In project we implement a few optimizations to the `P0` compiler used throughout the course and demonstrate the reductions in memory use or cpu time from the optimized code compared to the code produced by the original compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizations Implemented\n",
    "We implemented 4 optimizations. The first two remove unused code to reduce memory overhead, the second two simplify existing code for faster execution. \n",
    "1. Removing Unused Procedures\n",
    "1. Removing Unused Variables \n",
    "1. Dead Store Elimination\n",
    "1. Common Subexpression Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ordering\n",
    "We conduct our individual optimizations serially, in the order that we believed would eliminate the largest chunks of code first: procedures are generally larger than the effective \"lifetime\" of a variable, which in turn are larger than the sizes of the subexpressions we evaluate in Optimization #4. Thus, when moving down to a \"smaller\" chunk, we can be sure that this chunk is used by the surrounding code, rather than evaluating variables when the containing procedure is never used. Using this method, we can gaurantee that each sequential optimization has to iterate over the least amount code that we deem useful.\n",

    "### Unused Procedures Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example demonstrates unused procedures elimination. An \"unused procedure\" is when a procedure is defined, but that procedure is never used within the main program's function call graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in the example that although we define procedures b, c and e on lines 6, 22 and 42 respectively, we never call these procedures from the main program's function call graph. Notice in the example that procedure b is called within procedure c, but since procedure c is never called from the main program's function call graph, procedure b is also never called from the main program's function call graph. Notice in the example that procedure e is defined in procedure d and procedure d is called from the main program's function call graph, but procedure e is never called from the main program's function call graph.\n",

    "Future work includes implementing procedure inlining, which would save the overhead of procedure calls. This would eliminate even more defined procedures and as a result, reduce the amount of jal operations.\n",

However, since these writes are typically add or addi operations, the only savings we will see will be from fewer operations; add and addi operations are typically very quick instructions, especially compared to sw operations, which can take far longer."

We mark these as special case registers, and any `sw` operations writing to these locations are never removed. Additionally, these registers are always used with relative addresses, and those relative addresses are not always consistent throughout the entire use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider the following `P0` code. The `sw` at the beginning of the function block stores the value of `$fp` into the memory location `$sp - 8` (line 6). However, at the end of the function, the same memory location is refered to by the address `$fp - 4` (line 15). If we only considered exact memory locations, we would remove the first `sw` operations at the beginning of the function block, which would lead to incorrect code. "

Our intial approach consisted of scanning all \"blocks\", beginning with the main `program` block, looking for uses of variables. However, if a variable is used exclusively within a procedure, we do not detect that it is used, and therefore miss out on this declaration. The solution in this case is to scan the procedures _first_ and then scan the main `program` block.\n",
