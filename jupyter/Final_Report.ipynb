    "## Introduction\n",
    "The compiler problem is generally solved; that is, the task of translating an input text based on a known grammar and rules describing the desired output has a generally accepted solution. However, due to the vagueness and abstractness of the grammar and rules, the resulting code may be unnecessarily complex or inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The job of a compiler optimization is to make the resulting code more efficient, either in memory use or cpu time. In project we implement a few optimizations to the `P0` compiler used throughout the course and demonstrate the reductions in memory use or cpu time from the optimized code compared to the code produced by the original compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizations Implemented\n",
    "We implemented 4 optimizations. The first two remove unused code to reduce memory overhead, the second two simplify existing code for faster execution. \n",
    "1. Removing Unused Procedures\n",
    "1. Removing Unused Variables \n",
    "1. Dead Store Elimination\n",
    "1. Common Subexpression Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ordering\n",
    "We conduct the optimizations in order of size of the affected code: procedures are generally larger than the effective \"lifetime\" of a variable, which in turn are larger than the sizes of the subexpressions we evaluate in Optimization #4. Thus, when moving down to a \"smaller\" chunk, we can be sure that this chunk is used by the surrounding code. For instance, evaluating variable use is pointless when the containing procedure is never used. \n",

    "### Dead Store Elimination\n",
    "The following example demonstrates dead store elimination. A \"dead store\" is a memory operation that stores a value to a memory location, but that memory location is never read from for the rest of the program. Thus, this store is unused or \"dead\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in the example that although we store the value `5` to variable `b`, we never read that value from that variable. Thus the second `sw` operation to `b` is unneeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work includes eliminating unused writes to registers, which would save instructions. However, since these writes are typically `add` or `addi` operations, the only savings we will see will be from fewer operations; `add` and `addi` operations are typically very quick instructions, especially compared to `sw` operations, which can take far longer."

Our intial approach consisted of scanning all \"blocks\", beginning with the main `program` block, looking for uses of variables. However, if a variable is used exclusively within a procedure, we do not detect that it is used, and therefore miss out on this declaration. The solution in this case is to scan the procedures _first_ and then scan the main `program` block.\n",
